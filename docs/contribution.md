# Contribution

We are always open to contributions. Either in form of Pull Requests to the core package or self-made plugin packages.
We encourage everyone to prefer sending Pull Requests, however we don't promise that every plugin gets
merged into the core. If this is the case, it is not because we think your work is not good enough. We try to keep
the core as small as possible with the most widely used plugin implementations.

Even if we think that a plugin is not suitable for the core, we want to help you sharing your work with the community.
You can always open a Pull Request to place a link and a small description of your plugin on the
[Third Party Plugins](third-party-plugins.md) page. In special cases,
we might offer you to host your package under the PHP HTTP namespace.

For more details about contribution, please see our [contribution guide]().
